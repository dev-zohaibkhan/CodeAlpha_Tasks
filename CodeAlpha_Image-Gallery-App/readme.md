# Image Gallery with Category-Based Lightbox Navigation

A responsive and interactive **Image Gallery** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project includes category filtering, smooth hover effects, and a smart lightbox system that displays **only the selected category images** during navigation.

## Features

- Category-based image filtering (Nature, City, Animals)
- Lightbox navigation restricted to selected category
- Mobile-friendly and cross-browser compatible

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript


## How It Works

### 1. Image Filtering
- Clicking a category button (e.g., **Nature**) hides other category images
- Only selected category images remain visible in the gallery

### 2. Smart Lightbox Navigation
- Lightbox opens using **only visible images**
- Next and Previous buttons cycle **within the selected category**
- Prevents showing images from other categories while navigating

### 3. Responsive Design
- Uses CSS Grid for layout
- Automatically adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens


## Bonus Features

- Smooth hover zoom and brightness effects
